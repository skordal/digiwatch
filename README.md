Introduction
------------

DigiWatch is a digital clock for the ATtiny2313. It is written in assembler, but with preprocessor statements to make programming and reading the code easier.

The hardware consists of an ATtiny2313, four LCD displays, a couple of buttons (not implemented in the code yet), and a 4511 (BCD to 7-seg translator) and 7404 (inverters x6) chip. In addition, the hardware contains wires, lots of them, and a few other components.

How to build a DigiWatch
------------------------

Instructions will come in a later revision. They will include pictures and narrative :-) For now you can read the code as an educational experience if you feel like it.
